# Problem statement: Return the elements with the lowest and highest frequencies in the array.
# @pattern-log: Use a hash map to count frequencies, then scan the (key, count) pairs
#               while maintaining running min/max counters to find min/max-frequency elements.
# Time-Complexity: O(n) â€” one pass to count, one pass over unique keys
# Space-Complexity: O(k) where k is the number of unique elements (worst-case O(n))
